* Rough notes

[cite:@yakovenko2006antigenic] reports on an analysis of live oral poliovirus
vaccine (OPV). They quote a rate of \(\sim 3\times 10^{-2}\) substitutions per
synonymous site per year in wild-type virus, although their reference,
[cite:@gavrilin2000evolution] gives a range of estimates. In both cases this is
lower than the estimate used by [cite:@li2017quantifying] in which a value of
\(0.01\) was obtained via MrBayes. *N.b.* that [cite:@li2017quantifying] also
has some estimates of surveillance probabilities.

[cite:@yakovenko2014outbreak] reports on the molecular-epidemiological
analysis of an outbreak of poliomyelitis in Tajikistan in 2010. The
sequences were deposited in GenBank, and there is a weekly time series
of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases. They state that paralytic
disease only present in a minority of infections, approximately one
per 190 for WP1 (with a reference given).

[cite:@blake2014role] reports on an analysis outbreak of poliomyelitis in
Tajikistan and Republic of Congo in 2010 based on time-series data with an
interest in the role that older children and adults play in transmission. This
analysis formed the basis of the analysis from [cite:@li2017quantifying]. They
found that, in the case of Tajikistan, imperfect vaccine induced immunity was
less of a problem than the delay of vaccination once the outbreak had been
detected. In Republic of Congo, the effectiveness of vaccination was estimated
to be lower than for Tajikistan. They attribute the difference to differences in
sanitation. They acknowledge the potential cost of extending vaccination to
older age-groups.

[cite:@yakovenko2014outbreak] finds the epidemic likely started from a single
introduction from India, and that after that it spread within Tajikistan and
into neighbouring countries. They estimate that the single importation event
happened some time August--December 2009. They conclude that the outbreak was
possible due to low levels of (correct) vaccination, it was brought under
control by multiple rounds of vaccination. Figure 1 shows the timeline of the
outbreak and response.

[cite:@yakovenko2014outbreak] used BEAST1 for their analysis and they
have described the substitution model however, I would have liked a
bit more detail on the model specification: no XML files are made
available.

[cite:@li2017quantifying] uses the 2010 polio outbreak as a case study for joint
inference of time series (CDC report as source) and genomic data
([cite:@yakovenko2014outbreak]). They are particularly interested in the
estimation of the dispersion parameter \(k\), however in order to incorporate
this into a coalescent framework they need to approximate the model by putting
all infections at the end of the infectious period. They use a slightly
simplified version of the age-structured model from [cite:@blake2014role].

[cite:@li2017quantifying] use a strict clock in their analysis with an estimated
substitution rate of \(0.010\) obtained from MyBayes, and state this is inline
with previous estimates (with an associated citation).

The estimates from [cite:@li2017quantifying] are consist with previous
estimates. They find that the time series data is the most informative, but that
the genetic data helps to refine some of the estimates and provides more
information about the dispersion parameter \(k\).

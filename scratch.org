* Introduction

This document looks at downloading the sequence data described by
[cite:@yakovenko2014outbreak].

* Retrieving and organising the data

** Time series data

*NOTE:* Both [cite:@li2017quantifying] and
[cite:@yakovenko2014outbreak] talk about a linelist of cases, but I
haven't been able to find this dataset. For the time being it may be
necessary to use values obtained from the figure.

** Genomic data

*NOTE:* it looks like the following code for downloading the sequences
and putting the calendar dates on them may not be necessary. The
supplementary materials of [cite:@li2017quantifying] have a file with
the sequences already date stamped and aligned.

Load some libraries that facilitate downloading and munging the data.

#+begin_src R :tangle scratch.R :comments link
library(rentrez)
library(ape)
library(xml2)
#+end_src

We define a couple of files to store the results in so that they are
in one place and easy to manage. The accession numbers are given in
the paper, but since we need to hard-code them, we will include that
information here.

#+begin_src R :tangle scratch.R :comments link
  fasta_file <- "tajikistan-poliomyelitis.fasta"
  metadata_file <- "tajikistan-poliomyelitis-metadata.xml"

  tajikistan_accession_numbers <-
    seq.int(from = 880365, to = 880521)
  accession_numbers <- c(
    seq.int(from = 800662, to = 800683),
    seq.int(from = 812248, to = 812257),
    tajikistan_accession_numbers
  )
#+end_src

We download the sequences in a FASTA format and write this to file so
it is in a convenient format for subsequent work. Unfortunately, the
identifiers obtained in this way do not have the collection date on
them.

#+begin_src R :tangle scratch.R :comments link
  seqs <- entrez_fetch(
    db = "nucleotide",
    id = sprintf("KC%d", accession_numbers),
    rettype = "fasta"
  )

  writeLines(seqs, fasta_file)
#+end_src

Since we want to know which date the sequences were collected on, we
need to fetch the entry from the database as an XML object which
contains everything and is in the format used by the =XML= package.
Since this is not the easiest format to work with, we will save it to
file so that we can read it into an =xml2= type object which is easier
to extract information from.

#+begin_src R :tangle scratch.R :comments link
  foo <- entrez_fetch(
    db = "nucleotide",
    id = sprintf("KC%d", tajikistan_accession_numbers),
    rettype = "xml",
    parsed = TRUE
  )
  XML::saveXML(foo, file = metadata_file)
  foo <- read_xml(metadata_file)
#+end_src

We need to look into the XML and extract the textual representation of
the collection date and the accession number so that we can link this
data together.

#+begin_src R :tangle scratch.R :comments link
  qualifiers <- xml_find_all(
    foo, "//GBQualifier[GBQualifier_name[text()='collection_date']]"
  )
  collection_dates <-
    xml_text(
      xml_find_first(qualifiers, "./GBQualifier_value")
    )

  primary_accessions <-
    xml_find_all(foo, "//GBSeq/GBSeq_primary-accession")
  accession_texts <- xml_text(primary_accessions)
#+end_src

We need to put the collection dates into the identifers in the FASTA
file so that it is in a convenient format for subsequent analysis.
